# Data_Management-Test_and_Trace_Database
The database support a programme of testing for the Covid-19 virus and tracing  contacts of infected people. 
Test data records the data of the test, the result (positive or negative) and the details of the person tested (the ‘subject’). Consider that a single person may have many tests. Since some subjects may share a name, subjects are issued with a unique Subject ID. Some subjects may have more than one phone, but each phone number belongs to a single phone 
user.
Visit data records dates of visits to places of business. Each party must give one contact telephone number. The size of the party is also recorded.
